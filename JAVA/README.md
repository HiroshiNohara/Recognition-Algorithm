# Recognition-Algorithm(JAVA)

## Algorithms

- Original Local Binary Patterns (Original-LBP)
- Local Binary Patterns (LBP)
- Dual-Cross Patterns (DCP)
- Local Ternary Patterns (LTP)

## algorithm.java

>Encapsulating the Original LBP algorithm, DCP algorithm, etc, the texture features of the specified image can be obtained by calling any one of  `public Mat LBP(Mat src)`, `public Mat DCP1(Mat src, int Rin, int Rex)` or `public Mat DCP2(Mat src, int Rin, int Rex)`, etc.

## histogram.java

>Calculating a one-dimensional histogram of a feature image.

## traintest.java

>Train the training set according to the specified CSV file and test its recognition rate.

## entrance.java

>Program entry.

## Note

- The default grid_x and grid_y are taken as 1. If you want better recognition accurcy, set the value of grid_x and grid_y to 8. But note that this will bring more calculation work and program running time.
- When using the DCP algorithm, it is recommended to set Rin to 1 and Rex to 4.
- The LTP algorithm has two modes, adaptive threshold and non-adaptive threshold, depending on the adaptation value of the adaptation.
